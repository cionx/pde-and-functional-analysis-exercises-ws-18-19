\section{}


We assume that~$A$ is nonempty because otherwise~$d(-,A) = \infty$.



\subsection{}
\label{distance for closed}

It holds that~$d(x,A) = 0$ if and only if there exists for every~$n \geq 1$ some~$a_n \in A$ with~$d(x,a_n) < 1/n$, which means precisely that there exists a sequence~$(a_n)_n$ in~$A$ which converges in~$X$ to~$x$.
This happens if and only if~$x$ is contained in the sequential closure of~$A$, which conincides with the closure of~$A$ because~$(X,d)$ is a \emph{metric} space.





\subsection{}
\label{distance is lipschitz}

It holds that
\begin{align*}
          d(x,A)
   =      \inf_{a \in A} d(x,a)
  &\leq   \inf_{a \in A} d(x,y) + d(y,a)  \\
  &=      d(x,y) + \inf_{a \in A} d(y,a)
   =      d(x,y) + d(y,A)
\end{align*}
and therefore~$d(x,A) - d(y,A) \leq d(x,y)$.
It follows that also
\[
        d(y,A) - d(x,A) 
  \leq  d(y,x)
  =     d(x,y) \,.
\]
Together this shows that~$\abs{ d(x,A) - d(y,A) } \leq d(x,y)$.





\subsection{}

It follows from part~\ref{distance for closed} that the function~$d(-,A) + d(-,B)$ is positive because
\[
    \{x \in X \suchthat d(x,A) = 0\} \cap \{x \in X \suchthat d(x,B) = 0\}
  = \closure{A} \cap \closure{B}
  = A \cap B
  = \emptyset \,.
\]
The function
\[
            f
  \defined  \frac{d(-,B)}{d(-,A) + d(-,B)}
  \colon    X
  \to       [0,1] \,,
  \quad     x
  \mapsto   \frac{d(x,B)}{d(x,A) + d(x,B)}
\]
is therefore {\welldef}.
It follows from part~\ref{distance is lipschitz} that~$f$ is continous.
It holds that
\[
    f^{-1}(0)
  = \{
      x \in X
    \suchthat
      d(x,A) = 0
    \}
  = \closure{A}
  = A
\]
and
\begin{align*}
      f^{-1}(0)
  &=  \{
        x \in X
      \suchthat
        d(x,A) = d(x,A) + d(x,B)
      \}  \\
  &=  \{
        x \in X
      \suchthat
        d(x,B) = 0
      \}
  =   \closure{B}
  =   B \,,
\end{align*}
as desired.

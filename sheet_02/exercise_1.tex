\subsection{}

% The norm~$\norm{\,\cdot\,} \colon \ell_2 \to \Real$ is {\libcont} with~{\libconst}~$1$ by the inverse triangle inequality.
If the sequence~$(x^{(k)})_k$ would converge in~$\ell_2$ then this sequence would be a Cauchy sequencence.
But it holds for all~$l > k$ that
\[
    \norm{ x^{(l)} - x^{(k)} }_2
  = \sqrt{2} \,,
\]
which shows that this is not the case.





\subsection{}

It holds for all~$l \geq k$ that
\[
        \norm{ x^{(l)} - x^{(k)} }_2
  =     \left( \sum_{i=k+1}^l \frac{1}{i^2} \right)^{1/2}
  \leq  \left( \sum_{i=k+1}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2} \right)^{1/2}
  \to   0
\]
as~$k \to \infty$ because the sum~$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2}$ converges.
This shows that the sequence~$(x^{(k)})_k$ is a Cauchy sequence.
It follows from the completeness of~$\ell_2$ that this sequence converges.





\subsection{}

It holds for all~$l > k$ that
\begin{align*}
        \norm{ x^{(l)} - x^{(k)} }_2
   =    \left( \sum_{i=k}^{l-1} \frac{1}{i} + \sum_{i=2^k+1}^{2^l} \frac{1}{i} \right)^{1/2}
  &\geq \left( \sum_{i=2^k+1}^{2^{(k+1)}} \frac{1}{i} \right)^{1/2} \\
  &\geq \left( 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^{(k+1)}} \right)^{1/2}
   =    \frac{1}{2} \,,
\end{align*}
which shows that the sequence~$(x^{(k)})_k$ is not a Cauchy sequence.
It is therefore not convergent.
